# simple-kv-database
The purpose of this project is to create a simple version of a distributed, fault-tolerant, Key-Value (KV) database (or store).

## ðŸ“— Introduction

A Key-Value Database or Key-Value store is defined as a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays. In general, KV systems treat the data as a single opaque collection, which may have different fields for every record. These implementations often use less memory, and are used extensively in cloud computing. The most common data structure used in this frame include hash tables or dictionaries. The data stored inside the data structures, i.e. inside the dictionary, can be stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record.

In the frame of this project, the Trie data structure will be used. A Trie is also known as a digital or prefix tree, which means that Tries are a type of search trees. Tree data structures are used for locating specific keys from within a set, and in such structures there exist links between nodes that are defined not by the entire key but by individual characters. To access a particular key, that is to recover its value, change it, or remove it, the trie is traversed depth-first by following the links between nodes.

### ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have **Python 3.8.3** (or greater) installed on your computer. It possible that the implementation will run with other versions of Python.

Also, please make sure that the following libraries are installed and up-to-date:
* argparse
* socket
* sys
* os
* random
* itertools
* json
* csv
* string
